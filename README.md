# Assault-Teams-Onfoot-Cops-mod
Adds assault teams/onfoot cops that spawn during wanted levels, essentially making it look like an assault.

1-2 stars spawns a scripted police car (POLICE2) with 2 patrol officers

3-5 stars spawn variety of enemies like The FIB, NOOSE, Merryweather Black Ops Soldiers (with Combat MG)
each enemy carry different arsenals, from snipers to carbines.

Spawned Units will be removed by the game itself, so you wont get any piles of dead corpses everywhere.
